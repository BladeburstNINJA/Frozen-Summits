Before time, before form, there was Aoâ€”creator of the stars, the land, the seas, and the heavens. His will shaped the first elements, weaving the fabric of reality itself. The faithful believe that every cycle of creation and destruction is part of his divine design. Ao is the weaver of the cosmos, the force that keeps the balance of life and death in check, the one who created all things in harmony, with a purpose that stretches beyond mortal understanding."
