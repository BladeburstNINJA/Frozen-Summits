	desc = "Ao, The Prime Architect, is the primordial deity who gave birth to the very fabric of existence. Before time, before form, there was only Ao—the cosmic weaver of life, the bringer of all things into being. Ao’s will shaped the stars, the lands, the seas, and the heavens, weaving the delicate threads that connect all things in the grand tapestry of existence. It is said that the breath of Ao shaped the first elements, the first forces of creation, from which the world and all life emerged.\n\
		The faithful believe that Ao's work is eternal and ever-continuing, with each new dawn a reflection of the divine artistry that built the world. To worship Ao is to honor the ancient creator and acknowledge that all life, magic, and matter are the result of divine design. The followers of Ao seek to understand the mysteries of creation and to fulfill their roles as part of the grand design, striving to preserve the balance of life and existence. \n\
		There are those who believe Ao has withdrawn from the mortal plane, leaving the world to evolve according to the patterns of his creation. The truth of Ao’s presence is debated—some claim that the deity is ever-watchful, while others say Ao’s hand is no longer visible in the world. But those who follow the Prime Architect know that no matter the changes in the world, Ao’s design remains unbroken and eternal."
