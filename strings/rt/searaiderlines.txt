Praise the Bitch Queen.
Long live the Kaptin'!
Where did the rum go?
So far away from home...
Me Teeth are falling out...
We'll find a nice booty.
I could use a warm fire and a belly full of mead.
I wonder if she still thinks about me..
Shh, did you hear that?
There better be some Grog left...
And we all row , with the spray upon our necks...
We better make some fortune soon..
Stay alert!
*Hick*
Hoist the colors!
I think I heard something.
And the Bitch Queen stays the storm
Powder got wet...
Keep your blade sharp.
Dang Landlubbers.
I should be the captain..
Raining again...
Sick of this maggoty hardtack...
I need more moondust...
Ahoy!
Yoho...Yoho...
