It is with great pride I, Horatius Drackt, lifelong scholar of the Dwarvish culture, bring you this annotated and updated version of my classic manual. It has taken years of study and immersion to bring this comprehensive guide to  Dethek to your sitting rooms, and it is not a responsibility I take lightly - I'd refer you to my wife, Geirda, for evidence of my dedication, but she'd fob both of us with a pragmatic shrug. She often says my pursuit of Dethek is a waste of time, for nearly all dwarves speak the common tongue, and outsiders will never get the inflections right, anyway. I offer this humble tome as a tool to get you as far as any can toward that elusive goal. With great reverence I give you: Basics of Beginner's Dwarvish in its Seventh Edition."]}
