{"Contents":["This review of the quotidian operations of the Flaming Fist order was written by the Patriars' Appointed Panel, namely its spokesperson, Qesenya Cestor. She is, in a word, scathing in her appraisal. She compares the Fist to a wormy gangplank, once useful, now creaking and bound to break apart and crumble any day. She writes: 'I have seen more moral and ethical perception in my one-year old, who excavates his nose with a crayon daily, than in this order of supposed adults."]}
