{"Contents":["According to standard wisdom, the Weave is comprised of the body of Mystra, or the domain of Mystryl, the threads connecting all of creation to the source of magic itself.




I posit to the intrepid reader that the truth is far more fascinating.




The Weave as we know it is not invisible at all. No, certain among us, whom I call 'Seers,' can sense the true nature of the Weave as an incredibly fine but highly physical and edible substance left in our realm by space-faring giants called Immortums several aeons ago. Each time we 'wield' this power, creatures called Weave-devils consume these strands of Weave, and their excrement is a powerful force we call 'magic'. I know this will shock many readers, but I only deliver the facts as I know them - and as the 'esteemed' wizarding community wants to keep from you!"]}
