{"Contents":["And we all row! With the spray upon our necks,
And we all row! With the spray upon our backs,
And we all row! With the sea beneath our feet,
And the Bitch Queen stays the storm.

Wavemother, wavemother,
Lash us to the prow.
Wavemother, wavemother,
We ask to sail your skirt If you allow.
Wavemother, wavemother,
Sink us if you will.
Wavemother, wavemother,
Our skulls are yours
With brine and sand to fill.

Souls aweigh and anchors still!
The wind won't move
Without the Bitch Queen's will!
We'll wait gladly, years and days
Till the Bitch Queen brings the waves!
Hey! Ho!
She told us so!
Hey! Ho!
She told us so!"]}
