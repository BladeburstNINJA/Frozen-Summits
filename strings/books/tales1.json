"What you've got to understand is that half-orcs have no fixed home. They grow up all over the shop; here; there; everywhere!


Culture is a sort of gumbo cooked up out of all the parts of who you are, where you come from, who looks after you when you're small. Your fashion, linguistic cadence, word choice, how you view sex, table manners, farting - all these things are informed by 'home'.


Half-orcs are a big diaspora. Without a home, they must adopt the home - and therefore the culture - of others. There's nothing malicious about that. In fact it's wonderful seeing how they raise that culture they've adopted.


How will it grow in the garden of their hearts, unearthed and replanted, changed and rehoused?"]}
